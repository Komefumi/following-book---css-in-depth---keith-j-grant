# Following Book: CSS in Depth (Keith J. Grant)

Here I commit the progress I make following through this book written by Keith J. Grant, and released through Mannings' Publication

My work done is released with my licensing choice being the MIT license. I don't directly copy and paste the code but code that I've written here replicates and otherwise is identical to code used in the book with slight alterations

I use livereload and serve npm packages (run conveniently with the help of npx)

I use the prettier package through [vim-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier)
